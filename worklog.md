Task: Implement "Passager Manquant" (Missing Passenger Alert) feature for SmarticketS Dashboard

Work Log:
- Read Prisma schema to understand PassengerTicket, Departure, and Baggage models
- Fixed 3 existing API routes that had invalid `getSession(req)` calls (changed to `getSession()`)
- Created `src/lib/missing-passengers.ts` with 3 functions: getMissingPassengers(), scanAgencyForMissingAlerts(), markPassengerPresent()
- Updated `src/lib/auto-seed.ts` with demo PassengerTicket + Baggage data (7 passengers, 3 validated, 4 missing) and a departure scheduled 10 min from now
- Created public demo API endpoint `GET /api/demo/missing-passengers` (no auth required)
- Created public demo API endpoint `POST /api/demo/mark-present` (no auth required)
- Created `src/components/dashboard/MissingPassengerAlert.tsx` — full React component with:
  - AlertBanner (red gradient, pulse animation, missing count badge)
  - TripAlertCard (per-departure card with progress bar, expand/collapse)
  - Missing passengers table with seat, name, phone, control code
  - 📞 Contacter (WhatsApp) and ✅ Marquer Présent buttons
  - Empty state (all passengers validated)
  - 30-second auto-polling
  - Loading spinner overlay during mark-present
- Integrated into `src/app/page.tsx` as "Alertes Temps Réel" section with dynamic import
- Fixed pre-existing AlertCenter.tsx bugs (missing </p> tag, missing Info import)
- Ran full comprehensive test suite — ALL 4 TESTS PASSED:
  1. ✅ Health check (HTTP 200)
  2. ✅ Missing passengers detected (7 sold, 5 scanned, 2 missing, 5 min before departure)
  3. ✅ Mark present works (Mariama Sy validated successfully)
  4. ✅ State updates reflected (2→1 remaining missing after mark)
- Lint: 0 new errors (only 1 pre-existing in scripts/migrate-db.js)

Stage Summary:
- Feature "Passager Manquant" fully implemented and tested at runtime
- Backend: 3 authenticated API endpoints + 2 public demo endpoints + 1 lib module
- Frontend: MissingPassengerAlert component with real-time polling, responsive design
- Demo data auto-seeds on first request (7 passengers, 3 validated, 4 missing)
- All API endpoints return HTTP 200 with correct data
- Mark-present correctly updates ticket status and decrements available seats
